I am a postdoctoral researcher working in the field of artificial intelligence and remote sensing. I work jointly at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.kth.se/cs) of [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se) and at the [Department of Physical Geography](https://www.su.se/department-of-physical-geography/) of [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/english/) in Sweden. I am also a member of the Distributed Computing at KTH ([DC@KTH](https://dcatkth.github.io/)). Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/) (2018-2020). I got my PhD from [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/) in June 2019.

My research interests include:
* Natural Language Processing.
* Computer Vision.
* Deep Learning.
* Recommender Systems.
* Remote Sensing.
